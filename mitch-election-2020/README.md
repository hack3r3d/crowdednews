Every county in Kentucky. With his latest 2020 victory, Senator Mitch McConnell has now won every single county in Kentucky in at least one of his senate victories since 1984, according to [Center for Politics](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/coalition-shifts-in-senate-races-sc-ky-il/). I was 12 years old when McConnell took that senate seat from the Democrats.

Amy McGrath ran against McConnell in 2020. She didn't do well, only pulling in 38.2 percent of the vote. The only candidate to do worse against McConnell in his 6 reelection bids was Lois Combs Weinberg. Weinberg got only 35.3 percent in 2002.

That 1984 election that started McConnell's senate career was tight. McConnell road that Ronald Reagan rocket ship to the US Senate by barely beating Democratic Incumbent Walter Dee Huddleston. The margin of victory was 3,437 votes out of more than 1.2 million votes cast, according to [the Associated Press at the time](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XLRDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1340,2543281).
